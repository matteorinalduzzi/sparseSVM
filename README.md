Sparse SVM: linear SVM with L1-norm regularization
Project for the exam of Signal Processing and Optimization for Big Data
Master degree in computer engineering, curriculum Data Science
Matteo Rinalduzzi - Universit√† degli Studi di Perugia

This project aims to investigate 3 aspects:
- PART 1: implementation of SVM centralized version to evaluate the effect of L1 norm as lambda changes
- PART 2: comparison between centralized version and distributed version with ADMM, splitting
          across data (framework of CONSENSUS OPTIMIZATION)
- PART 3: distributed algorithm applied to a simple dataset of quasi linearly separable data in two dimensions
          and plot of the straight lines in the plane that separate the data (multiclass classification)
